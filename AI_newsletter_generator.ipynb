It hallucinates less than GPT-4o and o1, and outperforms GPT-4o in every category. GPT-4.5 will roll out to Plus and Team users next week and then to Enterprise and Edu users after that.

The free coding tool can be installed in Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and JetBrains developer environments and supports all programming languages in the public domain. Developers can instruct Gemini Code Assist using natural language, such as asking the coding chatbot to \"build me a simple HTML form with fields for name, email, and message, and then add a 'submit' button.\" The free Individual tier seems pretty expansive, but it doesn't include all of the advanced business-focused features available in the Standard and Enterprise versions of Gemini Code Assist.</p>\n",

The developers are part of a global cybercrime network called Storm-2139. The group compromised accounts with access to Microsoft's generative AI tools and managed to \"jailbreak\" them to create deepfakes of celebrities. The group then sold access to others, who used it to create deepfake nudes of celebrities, among other abuses. Celebrities, including Taylor Swift, have been frequent targets of deepfake pornography. There has been an ongoing debate in the AI community regarding the topic of safety and whether the concerns are real or rather intended to help major players like OpenAI gain influence and sell their products by over-hyping the true power of generative artificial intelligence. Legal means are one way in which those abuses can be addressed regardless of whether a model is open or closed.</p>\n",

However, Lasota's writings spun off in bizarre directions, blending personal experiences, theories about technology and philosophy, and esoteric comments about pop culture, computer coding, and other subjects. The group's beliefs include veganism, anarchism, and a justification for breaking laws. The Zizians have been linked to at least six killings, including a double homicide in Pennsylvania, a knife attack in California, and the shooting of a US border guard in January.
