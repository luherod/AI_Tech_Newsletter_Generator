# AI Newsletters Generator

## About this project

This project is a newsletter generator focused on AI news. It allows users to input their email, necessary API keys, audience technical level, and a date range. 
The tool then retrieves the top 10 most relevant AI news stories within the specified timeframe. 
Using the NewsAPI for news aggregation, the Qwen/Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct model from together.ai for content filtering, and SendGrid for email delivery, the system provides personalized, audience-tailored newsletters.
